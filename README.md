# Rubik's Cube Architecture Project

## Overview

This repository contains the design and simulation code for a Rubik's Cube architecture, structured into separate modules for key components. The project includes:

- Computational Unit (CU)
- 4x1 Multiplexer (MUX 4x1)
- Face Module
- Overall design and test cases

## Directory Structure

- [CU_Module](https://github.com/HanumanSagarBathula7392/Rubiks_Cube_Architecture/tree/main/CU_Module) Contains the design and simulation files for the Control Unit.
- [Face_Module](https://github.com/HanumanSagarBathula7392/Rubiks_Cube_Architecture/tree/main/Face_Module) Contains the design and simulation files for the 4x1 Multiplexer.
- [MUX_Module](https://github.com/HanumanSagarBathula7392/Rubiks_Cube_Architecture/tree/main/MUX_Module) Contains the design and simulation files for the Face representations.
- [Overall_Design_Module](https://github.com/HanumanSagarBathula7392/Rubiks_Cube_Architecture/tree/main/Overall_Design_Module) Contains the complete integrated design along with test case documentation.
- [Test_Cases](https://github.com/HanumanSagarBathula7392/Rubiks_Cube_Architecture/tree/main/Test_Cases)Includes five PDF files detailing different test scenarios.

## Usage

To simulate the design:

1. Navigate to the respective module folder.
2. Open the provided design files in your preferred HDL simulator.
3. Run the testbench provided to validate the functionality.

For the overall design:

1. Navigate to the [Overall_Design_Module](https://github.com/HanumanSagarBathula7392/Rubiks_Cube_Architecture/tree/main/Overall_Design_Module) directory.
2. Review the test cases in [Test_Cases](https://github.com/HanumanSagarBathula7392/Rubiks_Cube_Architecture/tree/main/Test_Cases) to understand the expected behavior.
3. Simulate the integrated design and compare results with the provided test cases.

## Requirements

- VHDL compatible simulator (e.g., Xilinx Vivado, ModelSim, Quartus Prime)
- HDL development environment

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests to improve the design or add more test cases.
